I feel us fading away. but could it stil be the time zones problem

i dont know i just want our spark back form the beginning, i still have it but dose she? i feel like im annoying her or
shes forcing herself to talk to me.

shes says we are dating but are we? or is she just trying to make me happy. Like i know shes pretty much use to people with autism 
but o feel like that holds her back in a way i dunno.

its just i have a feeling i cant explain when i talk to lily its more then love. Like i drop evreything just to reply 
to her messages. like the other day in class i dont think ive ever picked my phone up so fast
